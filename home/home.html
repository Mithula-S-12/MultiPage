                        Arts is a creative process that results in a visual work, such as a painting, sculpture, or photograph. It can also include performing arts, such as theater and dance, or other forms of expression, such as literature and music.Art is intended to evoke a worthwhile experience, often by expressing emotions, ideas, beauty, or technical proficiency. It can act as therapeutic relief, a conduit for self-expression, or simply a way to appreciate life's beauty. Through art, we can chronicle history, embody societal values, and comment on political or social events.The main purposes of art today are: Aesthetic: to deliver pleasure and motivate society. Expressive: to communicate emotions and feelings in a deeper way. Communicative: to convey ideas and messages to provoke reactions, going beyond traditional communication.The first artistic displays by humans date back to prehistoric times, when Homo sapiens decorated the interiors of caves, perhaps for narrative, shamanic or ritual purposes. Natural pigments, such as clay and iron oxide, were used to create these drawings on the walls of rock shelters. They depicted the way of life of these humans, animals and hunting scenes. A number of these paintings have survived to the present day.<br>
                        Art comes in many different forms which include audios, visuals and more. Audios comprise songs, music, poems and more whereas visuals include painting, photography, movies and more.
                        You will notice that we consume a lot of audio art in the form of music, songs and more. It is because they help us to relax our mind. Moreover, it also has the ability to change our mood and brighten it up.
                        After that, it also motivates us and strengthens our emotions. Poetries are audio arts that help the author express their feelings in writings. We also have music that requires musical instruments to create a piece of art.
                        Other than that, visual arts help artists communicate with the viewer. <br>
                        It also allows the viewer to interpret the art in their own way. Thus, it invokes a variety of emotions among us. Thus, you see how essential art is for humankind.
                        Without art, the world would be a dull place. Take the recent pandemic, for example, it was not the sports or news which kept us entertained but the artists. Their work of arts in the form of shows, songs, music and more added meaning to our boring lives.
                        sTherefore, art adds happiness and colours to our lives and save us from the boring monotony of daily life.<br>
